gameutils.js
============

## A Head Start on JavaScript Game Development

Gameutils.js is a collection of simple, modular helpers aimed at handling the tedious tasks of JavaScript game
development, enabling you to focus on the game content.

It is for people who like to mostly work with code rather than GUI-based tools, but aims to make this as simple as possible.

It is especially well suited for game jams and similar events.

It targets browsers that support modern APIs, and has been tested on Chrome, Firefox and Internet Explorer 11.
